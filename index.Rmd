I obtained my BBA in Finance from [The University of Georgia](https://www.terry.uga.edu/) in 2018. I am currently enrolled in the Master of Science, Biostatistics program at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.

My current research interests include climate and health, survival analysis, and determinants of obesity.

On a personal note, I enjoy hiking and camping. I love to read. And I like to watch NBA basketball.
