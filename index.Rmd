I obtained my BBA in Finance from [The University of Georgia](https://www.terry.uga.edu/) in 2018. I am currently enrolled in the Master of Science, Biostatistics program at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.

My current research interests include Bayesian inference, climate and health, and survival analysis.

In my personal time, I enjoy hiking and camping. I love to read. And I like to watch NBA basketball.
